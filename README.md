### 👋 Hi, I'm Cameron!
I’m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience building mobile and web applications across a range of industries. My core expertise lies in designing, building, and deploying robust RESTful APIs—primarily using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

Throughout my career, I’ve worn many hats: backend developer, team lead, and technical liaison. I’ve led small teams of developers, worked directly with clients to define and refine business requirements, and helped turn complex problems into clear, actionable solutions.

One of my strengths is adaptability—I’ve quickly picked up and applied a wide variety of tools, languages, and frameworks as projects demanded. Whether starting from scratch or working within legacy systems, I focus on delivering clean, maintainable code that solves real-world problems.
