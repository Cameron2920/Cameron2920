### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Cameron!
Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience building mobile and web applications across a range of industries.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worn many hats: backend dev, mobile dev, frontend dev, team lead, and technical liaison. Iâ€™ve led small teams of developers, worked directly with clients to define and refine business requirements, and helped turn complex problems into clear, actionable solutions.

One of my strengths is adaptabilityâ€”Iâ€™ve quickly picked up and applied a wide variety of tools, languages, and frameworks as projects demanded. Whether starting from scratch or working within legacy systems, I focus on delivering clean, maintainable code that solves real-world problems.
